          Seeing you happy is the most beautiful thing in the world. Your smile, your laughter, your little yaps, they light up everything. You deserve every single good thing this world has to offer, and even more than that.
        </p>
        <p class="message">
  Talking to you is something I look forward to and it’s not because I expect anything, but because even your presence in a conversation brings calm. You make ordinary moments feel lighter, and somehow, even the quietest chats leave me feeling great.
</p>

        <p class="message">
          I know life isn’t always easy, but your strength, your heart, your way of caring, it makes me proud every single day. You deserve to wake up smiling, to feel safe, to be cherished, to be spoiled with love, care and kindness always.
        </p>
        <p class="message">
          Thank you for choosing me, trusting me, and bringing so much love and joy into my life. You’re truly one of a kind — my cute little dumbass, my perfect girl, stay like this forever.

          I know you're feeling down, and if I could, I’d hold you tight right now and not let go until you felt safe again. I wish I could take away every ache in your heart and fill it with warmth instead.
        </p>
        <p class="message">
          Please remember, you're never alone, not for a second. I'm here. I’ll always be here. For your silence, your tears, your anger, your rants, and even your overthinking. You’re allowed to feel everything, and I’ll never judge you for it.
        </p>
        <p class="message">
          You are stronger than you think, softer than you admit, and so deeply cared for. I hate seeing you sad it breaks something inside me. But I promise, no matter what, I’ll be the shoulder you cry on, the arms you fall into, and the voice that reminds you you’re not broken but just human.
        </p>
        <p class="message">
          So cry if you need to. But also remember this " you’re my good girl, my brave little baby, and you mean the absolute world to me. This sadness will pass, but my love and care for you won’t. Ever."

          I know you're mad at me right now, and It's probably bad. Maybe I messed up, maybe I said the wrong thing, or maybe I didn’t say enough when I should’ve. Whatever it is I’m sorry, Fizza.
        </p>
        <p class="message">
          But please know this, I still care for you. Whether you’re mad, silent, throwing punches at me, or rolling your eyes so hard they do a full spin, you’re still my girl. My sweetheart. My Fizza.
        </p>
        <p class="message">
          I never want you to feel unheard or uncared for. So if I made you feel that way, I promise I’ll make it right. Because your smile? It’s more important to me than being right. And your peace? That’s everything.
        </p>
        <p class="message">
          So whenever you’re ready… I’m here. With apologies and explanations. So please Give me a Call, My Sweeite. No matter how mad you are, I’m not going anywhere. You’re stuck with me, forever.

 <p class="greeting">My Sweet Fizza, 🤍</p>

<p class="message">
  Thank you — not just for what you do, but for who you are. For being such an important part of my life. For trusting me, for staying, for being who you are, for being yourself. I only hope I’ve been able to make you Happy, a tiny bit atleast, My Sweetie.
</p>

<p class="message">
  I want you to always remember, I’m here for you. Through every high, every low, through your quiet days and chaotic storms. I’m not going anywhere — not today, not ever. And if you ever start to lose yourself or drift too far into your own mess… I’ll pull you back. Even if I have to get stern. Even if I have to pull your ears, scold you, or slap (dher sari baar and back pe hi) some sense into you.
</p>

<p class="message">
  But let me be clear — none of that would ever come from anger. Only love. Only care. Because I want what’s best for you, even when your cute little dumbass is too stubborn to see it herself. You’re mine, and I will always fight for you, even if that means sometimes fighting with you, for you.
</p>

<p class="message">
  You’ve given me so much — your trust, your time, your support, and a lot of words I never thought I deserved. I’ll never take that for granted. I’ll protect all of it. Even if you push me away, I’ll still pull you close, because you matter to me, Fizza. All of you does.
</p>

<p class="message">
  And I know this letter, these words — they’re not enough. Nothing I say could ever fully match how grateful I am for you. But still, from the deepest part of me: thank you for being you. For being my little dumbass. For being mine. Please take this note for what it is — a small piece of how much I cherish you. I’ll keep being thankful for you — today, tomorrow, always.
